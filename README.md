This repository contains materials used during a presentation at the 2024 Assessment Institute in Indianapolis, IN titled "Data Visualization in R".  Files of interest will be:
  - "Slides.pdf": slides exported to pdf format
  - The .png files are examples embedded in the slides.  Some are from simulated "toy" data and others are from the web.
